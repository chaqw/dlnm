Changes since dlnm 1.5.1 (5 Jan 2012) : further info
===================================

Since version 1.5.1, the dlnm package includes important changes.
Basic info are provided in:
file.show(system.file("ChangeLog",package="dlnm"))

The main changes involve the function 'crossbasis', for which a completely new 
usage has been implemented. This new approach eliminates the long list of 
arguments used to specify the two basis functions for the two dimensions, and 
replaces them with two arguments argvar and arglag. These are lists of the same
arguments to be passed to the new function 'onebasis', which in turn replaces
'mkbasis' and 'mklagbasis'. The other important change involves the argument
maxlag, now replaced by lag, optionally a vector of 2 values specifying min and 
max lag.

The main issue with the new version is that the compatibility of the old code 
is not complete. Old arguments of 'crossbasis' are still accepted, passed 
through ..., but, unfortunately, the attributes of the created cross-basis 
matrix are now different, and any call to one of the old attributes will 
return NULL.

The code included in as online material of published articles still works and
produces the same results, although returning a warning about the new usage of
'crossbasis'. However, user-defined code may not work anymore, and users need 
to modify it compatibly with the new version.

These changes have been included in order to simplify the syntax and to allow
for future changes.

The authors apologize for the inconvenience.
