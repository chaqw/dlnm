Changes in dlnm 2.2.0 (14 March 2016) : further info
===================================

Since version 2.2.0, the centering procedure has been moved from basis
generation to basis prediction, namely from onebasis()-crossbasis() to
crosspred()-crossreduce(). This change simplifies the steps for obtaining
predictions with different references, as it avoids refitting the model each
time. It also simplifies the internal structure of the package.

The user is required to specify the centering point through the same argument
'cen', which however is now included in crosspred() or crossreduce(). If
specified in onebasis() or crossbasis(), a warning is returned, and the info is
kept for backward compatibility with previous code. However, the user is
strongly suggested to adopt the new usage.

An updated version of code published in various articles is available at:
www.ag-myresearch.com

For general info on the package, type help(dlnm) and vignette('dlnmOverview')
