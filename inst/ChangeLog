Changes in dlnm 1.6.2 (17 Apr 2012)
===================================

Major changes
-------------

    o Bug fixed in onebasis() regarding the argument 'cen'. Now cen=0 and 
      cen=FALSE do not return the same value, and in the former the centering
      is acknowledged by summary(). Thanks to Yasushi Honda.

Minor changes
-------------

    o Documentation changed accordingly.


==============================================================================
Changes in dlnm 1.6.1 (13 Apr 2012)
===================================

Major changes
-------------

    o Argument 'bylag' included in crosspred() and crossreduce() to define the
      sequence of lag values used for prediction. It does not apply to
      cumulative effects.

Minor changes
-------------

    o Documentation changed accordingly.


==============================================================================
Changes in dlnm 1.6.0 (26 Mar 2012)
===================================

Major changes
-------------

    o crossbasis() and crosspred() now accept as 'x' argument also a matrix of    
    exposure histories. The package now works also with non-time series data,
    for example cohort or case-control data. The documentation will be changed
    accordingly as soon as the methodological paper will be published.

Minor changes
-------------

    o onebasis() now accepts vectors/matrices for less than df+int observations.
      crosspred() and crossreduce() changed accordingly.


==============================================================================
Changes in dlnm 1.5.3 (21 Feb 2012)
===================================

Minor changes
-------------

    o Change in colnames(crossbasis).

    o Fixed bug in lines.crosspred() and points.crosspred()

See also: file.show(system.file("Changesince151",package="dlnm"))

Major changes
-------------

    o New function onebasis() to create the 1-dimensional basis matrices. The 
      function is made available and documented. This replace mkbasis() and
      mklagbasis(), which are kept only for compatibility. The functions returns
      a matrix with attributes.

    o The usage of crossbasis() has been extensively revised. Now the function
      has 2 arguments var and lag with a list of arguments for each space. Also,
      maxlag has been replaced by lag, defining the lag range (min and max). Old
      usage has been kept (with a warning) for compatibility reasons. 

    o New function crossreduce() to reduce the fit to one of the 2 dimensions. 
      Methods functions (summary, plot, points, lines) are also included.
      
    o	crosspred() changed accordingly: now prediction also from simple basis,
      and computation based on faster new method in crossreduce().

    o Argument cenvalue eliminated from basis()-crossbasis(): centering now
      entirily determined by cen, which can be logical or numeric.
	
Minor changes
-------------

    o Bug fixed in onebasis() (previously mkbasis()) for type hthr-lthr.

    o Internal functions included: .onAttach() and .fci().

    o coef and vcov methods for crosspred() and crossreduce().

    o	In onebasis()-crossbasis(): bound and cen argument now with no default.
      degree=3 returned now for type='ns', similarly to the original function.

    o In plot functions: changed default of ptype, added default titles.

    o In plots and documentation: effects changed to outcome-association.

    o Documentation and examples changed accondingly with changes above.


==============================================================================
