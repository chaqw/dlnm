Changes in dlnm 1.2.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

	"strata" and "-thr" there's the chance to generate collinear
	variables: included a warning in help for crossbasis().

    o	Vignette 'dlnmOverview" rearranged with new examples, one of 
	them on seasonal analysis. Reference to new paper Gasparrini
	2010 Stat Med.

Changes in dlnm 1.1.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The estimate of the cumulative effects along lags has been
	included in crosspred() and can be plotted with crossplot()
	setting 'cumul=T'.

    o	The confidence intervals for 'type' equal to "slices" or
	"overall" can be now represented both by "area" (default),
	"bars" or "lines", by the argument 'ci' in crossplot().

-------------

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.


Changes in dlnm 1.0.2
=======================

Changes in dlnm 1.0.1
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The dataset chicagoNMMAPS has been added, relaxing the dependence
	on the package NMMAPSlite. Now the examples can be run using
	these data and without an internet connection.

    o	The function crosspred() has been improved: now there is no
	constraint on the range of the predicted values. Moreover, the
	values 'model.class' and 'model.link' have been added. The
	command now works also when the estimation is carried out by
	'clogit()'.

Minor changes
-------------

    o	The section 'Functions' in the vignette 'dlnmOverview' has been
	reduced: a reference to the functions help pages has been added.

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.4.1
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The argument 'degree' included in mkbasis()-crossbasis(),
	defining the degree of the unconstrained B-spline ('type' equal 
	to 'bs') or the maximum power of the polynomial ('type' equal to 
	'poly').

    o	Linear piecewise function above a threshold included for
 	type='hthr'/'lthr'; added an example in help pages and vignette.

Improvements
------------

    o	Automatic knot selection also for thr-type functions

    o	New example related to the changes above in the help pages and
 	in the vignette

    o	Improved error messages in mkbasis() and mklagbasis()

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	Choices and error messages in mkbasis() and mklagbasis()

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Double threshold type changed from 'thr' to 'dthr'; added an
 	error message in mkbasis() to explain the change.

    o	For type='dthr', knots choice when more than 2 changed from first
 	two to first and last ones. 

    o	Basis choices changed in example3 in order to show a quadratic
 	spline.

    o	Examples for mkbasis()-mklagbasis() expanded in help pages and
 	vignette.

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.3.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	A contour/level plot has been added to crossplot().

    o	The option 'bs' has been added to the argument 'type' of
	mkbasis()-crossbasis(), to specify a cubic spline without
	natural constraints.

Improvements
------------

    o	Argument 'ylim' added for 'type="3d"'.

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Minor bugs fixed in mkbasis() and mklagbasis().

    o	Typing errors fixed in vignette 'dlnmOverview'.

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.

Corrections
-----------

    o	Original series of pollutants in NNMAPS data given by *tmean
	and *mtrend, not *mean and *trend. Corrected


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.2.1
=======================

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	par options in crossplot()

    o	titles for 'slices' in crossplot()


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.2.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The package vignette 'dlnmOverview' has been added.

Improvements
------------

    o	Intercept added to type equal to 'thr', 'hthr', 'lhr', and 'lin'

    o	The vector 'predvar' of predictor values for which the prediction
 	must be performed, included in crosspred(), is now automatically
	ordered and made unique.

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	Two links to mkbasis() and mklagbasis() added to the help of
	crossbasis() in order to let the internal functions help page
	available

    o	par(par.old) included in 'type="slices"' for crossplot() in order
 	to redifine a single plot after the command

    o	Error messages added to mkbasis() if argument types are wrong

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Default value for argument 'lagbound' of crossbasis() changed
 	from	c(-1,maxlag) to c(0,maxlag).

    o	Help pages changed accordingly with the new features.

    o	The example 2 (in crosspred()) the threshold has been set to
 	40.3, in order to show the ordering functionality.
