=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.4.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The argument 'degree' included in mkbasis()-crossbasis(),
	defining the degree of the unconstrained B-spline ('type' equal 
	to 'bs') or the maximum power of the polynomial ('type' equal to 
	'poly').

    o	Linear piecewise function above a threshold included for
 	type='hthr'/'lthr'; added an example in help pages and vignette.

Improvements
------------

    o	Automatic knot selection also for thr-type functions

    o	New example related to the changes above in the help pages and
 	in the vignette

    o	Improved error messages in mkbasis() and mklagbasis()

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	Choices and error messages in mkbasis() and mklagbasis()

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Double threshold type changed from 'thr' to 'dthr'; added an
 	error message in mkbasis() to explain the change.

    o	For type='dthr', knots choice when more than 2 changed from first
 	two to first and last ones. 

    o	Basis choices changed in example3 in order to show a quadratic
 	spline.

    o	Examples for mkbasis()-mklagbasis() expanded in help pages and
 	vignette.

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.3.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	A contour/level plot has been added to crossplot().

    o	The option 'bs' has been added to the argument 'type' of
	mkbasis()-crossbasis(), to specify a cubic spline without
	natural constraints.

Improvements
------------

    o	Argument 'ylim' added for 'type="3d"'.

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Minor bugs fixed in mkbasis() and mklagbasis().

    o	Typing errors fixed in vignette 'dlnmOverview'.

    o	Help pages, examples and vignette changed accordingly.

Corrections
-----------

    o	Original series of pollutants in NNMAPS data given by *tmean
	and *mtrend, not *mean and *trend. Corrected


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.2.1
=======================

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	par options in crossplot()

    o	titles for 'slices' in crossplot()


=======================
Changes in dlnm 0.2.0
=======================

Major changes
-------------

    o	The package vignette 'dlnmOverview' has been added.

Improvements
------------

    o	Intercept added to type equal to 'thr', 'hthr', 'lhr', and 'lin'

    o	The vector 'predvar' of predictor values for which the prediction
 	must be performed, included in crosspred(), is now automatically
	ordered and made unique.

Fixed bugs
----------

    o	Two links to mkbasis() and mklagbasis() added to the help of
	crossbasis() in order to let the internal functions help page
	available

    o	par(par.old) included in 'type="slices"' for crossplot() in order
 	to redifine a single plot after the command

    o	Error messages added to mkbasis() if argument types are wrong

Minor changes
-------------

    o	Default value for argument 'lagbound' of crossbasis() changed
 	from	c(-1,maxlag) to c(0,maxlag).

    o	Help pages changed accordingly with the new features.

    o	The example 2 (in crosspred()) the threshold has been set to
 	40.3, in order to show the ordering functionality.
