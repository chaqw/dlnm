\title{ Define Exposure Histories from an Exposure Profile }

\description{
This function builds a matrix of exposure histories given an exposure profile, the time points at which each exposure history is evaluated, and a lag period.
}

\usage{
exphist(exp, time, lag)
}

\arguments{
  \item{exp }{ an exposure profile defined at equally-spaced time units, from time 1 on.}
  \item{time }{ either a numeric scalar or vector of positive integer numbers specifying the time points at which each exposure history is evaluated. By default, all the time points of \code{exp}.}
  \item{lag }{ either an integer scalar or vector of length 2, defining the the maximum lag or the lag range, respectively. By default, the lag period from 0 to \code{length(exp)-1}.}
}

\details{
This function is used to define matrices of exposure histories to be used in \code{\link{crosspred}} for obtaining predictions.

The exposure profile in \code{exp} is assumed to represent a series of exposure events defined forward in time, starting from time 1 and on. An exposure history is then evaluated backward in time for each point defined by \code{time} (rounded to integers) on the lag period defined by \code{lag}.

If the values in \code{time} are higher than the length of \code{exp}, or if the lag period extends backward before the beginning of the exposure profile, the exposure history is padded with 0's.
}

\value{
A numeric matrix of exposure histories, with rows corresponding to the values in \code{time} and columns corresponding to the lag period in \code{lag}.

\examples{
### an exposure history evaluated at a single time
(exp <- sample(1:10))
exphist(exp, 5, 3)
exphist(exp, 5, 12)
exphist(exp, 15, 3)

### use of argument lag
exphist(exp, 15, c(3,7))

### exposure histories evaluated at multiple times
exphist(exp, 3:5, 12)
exphist(exp, lag=12)
